    name: 'Olive Garden',
    employmentPeriod: 'Aug 2013 - Sept 2015',
    positionsHeld: 'Utility, Salad/Alley, Production, Pasta, Back of House Certified Trainer',
    description1: 'Having Worked multiple positions available in the back of house at Olive Garden, I became a certified trainer to allow me to make sure new team members would be trained properly. I worked each back of house job available at Olive Garden.',
    description: "Working at Olive Garden was an excellent first experience in a workplace. I started as a dishwasher and very quickly moved up to working almost every position. I became a trainer because I saw an opportunity to make the work environment better. There are places where you need to be strict especially when it comes to food, but this often meant trainers were fairly hostile to new people. During my time at Olive garden, I learned a lot about managing new employees in a fast paced environment and it has served me very well."

    name: 'The Grass Chopper',
    employmentPeriod: 'May 2014 - Aug 2014',
    positionsHeld: 'Lawnmower / Landscaper',
    description: 'Working for the Grass Chopper was as a summer job. I mowed lawns and did landscaping when it was needed. While not a particularly exciting job, it really taught me to struggle through the weeds.'

    name: 'Ted’s Montana Grill, Bozeman',
    employmentPeriod: 'Oct 2015 - Sept 2016',
    positionsHeld: 'Line Cook, Chef',
    description: "I moved to Ted’s from Olive Garden for a better opportunity to cook food which I really enjoy. I worked as a back of house cook and a line cook when required. There were only three house cooks at Ted's which meant we all heavily relied on one another to get our jobs done. Being the morning cook, there was a limited number of items you needed to get through, so I spent my time figuring out the most efficient way to get through my list in order to help out the line cooks. My time at Ted's was worthwhile, having taught me to further work in a high paced environment while allowing me to make some friends I have to this day."

  {
    name: 'Rooks Comics and Games, Bozeman',
    employmentPeriod: 'Aug 2016 - May 2018',
    positionsHeld: 'Sales Floor Associate',
    description: "After Having worked in the back of house at  restaurants, I welcomed the opportunity to work at Rooks. After just a short while, I realized that I really enjoy interacting directly with customers and helping people find what they need - if I get to talk about something I enjoy, it really doesn’t feel like work. I was hired on at Rooks because of my extensive knowledge of the products and the Rook's regulars. My absolute favorite part of the job was the back and forth with recurring customers trying to imptove their warhammer armies or card game decks."

    name: 'McDonalds Bozeman',
    employmentPeriod: 'Oct 2017 - December 2018',
    positionsHeld: 'Floor Supervisor',
    description: 'I started working at McDonalds to save up for my wedding, quickly moving from a crew member to a floor supervisor. I worked every position from taking orders on the counter to assembling the food. Also, as an opening floor supervisor I managed the safe and made sure all of the drawers were properly counted. It became very obvious to me when I started working at McDonalds that my past work experience in restaurants stuck with me. This was clear, because my first full month working, I got employee of the month and my first month as a floor supervisor, I recieved floor supervisor of the month. Another element from this job is that the turnover rate was more than 100%, which is crazy to think about. This meant I was training new employees all the time and tossing them into the hectic environment that is fast food service. I learned to help others manage stress in the same way I do, something I carry with me to this day.'

{
  name: 'Bequet Confections',
  employmentPeriod: 'May 2019 - Present',
  positionsHeld: 'Associate Trainer',
  description: 'Not long after starting at Bequet, I learned most tasks for the business. I work everything from the customer point of sale to tasks in the cooking room. I was moved into a trainer position very quickly for my ability to articulate and understand the important aspects of our job. My past work experience in significantly faster paced environments allows me to excell in our everyday situations. I have made myself reliable in all job positions at Bequet, picking up tasks quickly and soonafter mastering them.'
